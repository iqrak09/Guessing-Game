# Guessing-Game

Picture this exciting guessing game where the computer selects a number between 1 and 100 at random! The player's goal is to guess this number within a set number of attempts, usually around 10. With each guess, the computer gives helpful feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low. The game goes on until the player correctly guesses the number or uses up all their attempts. It's a great way for players to challenge themselves and work on their guessing skills, or simply have fun testing their luck at finding the secret number. Let the games begin!
